Usage
Inputs:
X = matrix with n_x d_x-dimensional points, i.e. X has d_x rows and n_x columns  
Y = matrix with n_y d_y-dimensional points, i.e. Y has d_y rows and n_y columns
mu is the measure on X, i.e. a n_x by 1 dimensional matrix sum(mu) = 1
nu is the measure on Y, i.e. a n_y by 1 dimensional matrix sum(nu) = 1
relative error is the gap you would like to have e.g. 1e-4
linearterm is an (optional) Wasserstein linear linear term
